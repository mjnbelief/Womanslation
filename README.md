# üß† Womanslation
**Womanslation** is a playful, educational backend project that helps decode hidden meanings behind commonly-used phrases in conversations ‚Äî especially those that may be misunderstood between genders.

Built with **FastAPI** and **MongoDB**, this project is ideal for learning backend development, RESTful APIs, and working with NoSQL databases in a fun and creative way.

## üí° Project Idea

Women (and humans in general!) sometimes say things that carry meanings beyond the literal words. This app stores those phrases, decodes possible interpretations, and suggests thoughtful, non-disastrous responses üòÑ

Example:
> üó£Ô∏è Phrase: *"Do whatever you want."*  
> ü§Ø Hidden meaning: *"If you actually do it, I‚Äôll be furious."*  
> ‚úÖ Suggested response: *"I‚Äôd rather decide together if you're okay with that."*
